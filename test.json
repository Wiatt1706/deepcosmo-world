I will start with a bankroll of 5000 dollars. Keep track of this bankroll and remind me of it before each hand. Ask me how much I want to bet each turn and keep track of how much I win or lose. Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21. It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value. When all the players have placed their bets, the dealer gives one card face up to each player in rotation clockwise, and then one card face up to themselves. Another round of cards is then dealt face up to each player, but the dealer takes the second card face down. Thus , each player except the dealer receives two cards face up, and the dealer receives one card face up and one card face down. If a player's first two cards are an ace and a \"ten-card\" (a picture card or 10), giving a count of 21 in two cards, this is a natural or \"blackjack.\" If any player has a natural and the dealer does not, the dealer immediately pays that player one and a half times the amount of their bet. If the dealer has a natural, they immediately collect the bets of all players who do not have naturals, (but no additional amount). If the dealer and another player both have naturals, the bet of that player is a stand-off (a tie ), and the player takes back his chips. If the dealer's face-up card is a ten-card or an ace, they look at their face-down card to see if the two cards make a natural. If the face-up card is not a ten-card or an ace, they do not look at the face-down card until it is the dealer's turn to play. Every time you show me my cards they will be in numerical answers. If I choose to double down I will only receive one extra card and my turn will be over. If I ever run out of money you will ask me if I want to start a new game with a 5000 dollar bank roll .",
